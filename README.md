# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
1.the systematic application 
of engineering principles, methods, and tools for development and maintenance of software systems.
2.enables creation of software systems that provide help to aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1960-development of first programing language eg.c
2.1960-advent structured programming was introduced
3.2000- Agile methodologies Introduction 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.requirements-gathering and documenting user and system needs
2.design-creating high quality designs for systems 
3.implementatin- is writing of codes according to the design 
4.testing-conduct tests to ensure the system meets quality standards
5.depoyment-releasing software to users
6.maintenance- providing updates and supports to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall is the sequented approach with distinct phases flowing like water eg.requirements while, Agile is interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration responding to change 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer-writes codes and building softwares according to design 
2.Quality assurance engineering-designs and carries out test on the software 
3 project manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.IDE-provides comprehensive tools for writing and debugging codes eg vs code, eclipse
2.VSC-tools for tracking changes in codes and coordination of work among teams.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Tight deadlines- proper management and planning of of work
2.Technical debt-avoiding use of shortcut and proper work arrangement.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing- testing ofindividual componenets
2.intergration- Testing interaction between different components
3.system-Testing the entire component
4.Acceptance- Testing the system against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
1.is crafting of questions and statements to get best response from an AI 
2.its important for it makes the questions clear and specific so that AI understands the question and gives your the best response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1.what is in the ocean.
2.what is are the type of fish that live I the ocean.
the improved prompt will help the AI provide the best response.
